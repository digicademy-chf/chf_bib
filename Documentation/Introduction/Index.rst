Introduction
============

The extension allows you to build a comprehensive bibliography in your TYPO3
project. It can either be automatically imported from Zotero or edited in the
TYPO3 backend. In case you are building an annotated bibliography, entries may
also contain summary and description texts, (cover) images, and files. The
extension was originally designed for academic projects in the Digital
Humanities, but should work just as well for any other academic and
non-academic domain.

..  attention::

    The extension does not currently include a generic frontend template. To
    use it, you may thus need (someone with) knowledge of how templating works
    in TYPO3.
