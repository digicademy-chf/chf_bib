Introduction

The extension allows you to build a comprehensive bibliography in your TYPO3
project. It can either be automatically imported from Zotero or edited in the
TYPO3 backend. In case you are building an annotated bibliography, entries may
also contain summary and description texts, (cover) images, and files. The
extension was originally designed for academic projects in the Digital
Humanities, but should work just as well for any other academic and
non-academic domain. The extension is part of the Cultural Heritage Framework
(CHF), which provides additional functionality such as glossary entries,
geodata, and various additional data models.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
